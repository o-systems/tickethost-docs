# Getting Started

## Event Goers

We provide an easy and intutive expereince when onboarding users to the platform.
The process starts with clicking on an event, among the listed events or signing- up for an account.
Either option gets a user a unique account on the platform.

The account created, allows a user to be able to [buy](/tickets) and [sell tickets](/organisers/create_event) for the event.

To get more details on how to buy tickets, the guided walk through can be accessed at: [How to Buy A Ticket](/tickets)

## Event Organisers

For an event organiser, the user will need to log into their dashboard to be able to list an event.
The event creation process can be accessed on the [link]().
